# In-Class 06 - Michael Anderson

## Typography:
- I picked "Courgette" for the main title (Fashion) since it was the most readable fancy/cursive font that I could find 
	- I feel that this font is pretty fashionable, which is why I picked it 
- I picked "Arima Madurai" for the subheaders, since it reminded me of an upright/unitalicized version of "Courgette"
	- This font is fancy due to the curves while not being as fancy as the main font, which was intentional 
- I picked "Markazi Text" for the paragraphs since it was more readable than the original font
	- I think the small serifs make it pair well with the fancier title fonts 

## Readability/Design:
- I increased font size across the board, since the original sizes were way too small for the site to be readable 
- I looked up ideal line heights on Google and chose one in that range (1.4)
- The original grids werent designed for the content within them (content didnt fit properly) so I evened things out 
- Having a single nav link in the middle of the top looked odd so I moved it to be side by side with the h2
- I made the banner on the top of the page fancier by giving it a pattern
